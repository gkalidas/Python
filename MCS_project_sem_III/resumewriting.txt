1) More than one page- Make every word count as if you were being charged money to place them there. Have some jobs from the 90’s? just add the company and date range.

?2) More than 5 bullets - The resume is a sales tool….sell me. Does a weight loss pill sell by describing it’s benefits in paragraph form? No, it sells by providing you with 1–2 impactful statements like “reduces belly fat in 3 weeks”

?3) Duties- recruiters care about what you achieved, not what you were assigned to do. Take the time to quantify each bullet point…for example: “I did X which resulted in Y.” If you don’t have measurable bullet points try to be as clear as you can (Did you help students? How many?)

?4) Objective -We all know the objective is to get the job, have a great boss, and be on a team that respects you.

?5) Personal pronouns - when listing bullet points don’t speak in third or first person by saying “I managed a team” or “Bob managed a team”, simply say “managed a team”

?6) Buzz-words - avoid words like results-oriented, synergy, think outside the box, go-getter. Also, no Microsoft office.

?7) Company specific phrases - stay away from phrases or acronyms that only people on the inside of your current company use.
